This make changes to the application slow as it affects the entire system. A modification made to a small section of code might require building and deploying an entirely new version of software. Scaling specific functions of an application, also means you have to scale the entire application.</p>\n<p>Microservices solve these challenges of monolithic systems by being as modular as possible. In the simplest form, they help build an application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and are independently deployable. These services may be written in different programming languages and may use different data storage techniques. While this results in the development of systems that are scalable and flexible, it needs a dynamic makeover. Microservices are often connected via APIs, and can leverage many of the same tools and solutions that have grown in the RESTful and web service ecosystem.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><span style=\"color: SteelBlue;\">Benifits of microservice</span></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Decoupling :</strong></span> Services within a system are largely decoupled, so the application as a whole can be easily built, altered, and scaled.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Simpler To Deploy :</strong></span> Deploy in literal pieces without affecting other services.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Reusability :</strong></span> Share small services like payment or login systems across the business.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Faster Defect Isolation :</strong></span> When a test fails or service goes down, isolate it quickly with microservices.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Autonomy :</strong></span> Developers and teams can work independently of each other, thus increasing speed.\n<br/><br/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>Mixed Technology stack :</strong></span> as microservices allow developers to use multiple languages in developing these services<br/><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1><span style=\"color: SteelBlue;\">characterstics of microservice</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong>1- Multiple Components :</strong></span><br/><br/>\nsoftware built as microservices can, by definition, be broken down into multiple component services. Why? So that each of these services can be deployed, tweaked, and then redeployed independently without compromising the integrity of an application. As a result, you might only need to change one or more distinct services instead of having to redeploy entire applications. But this approach does have its downsides, including expensive remote calls (instead of in-process calls), coarser-grained remote APIs, and increased complexity when redistributing responsibilities between components.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">2- <strong>Built For Business :</strong></span><br/><br/>\nThe microservices style is usually organized around business capabilities and priorities. Unlike a traditional monolithic development approach—where different teams each have a specific focus on, say, UIs, databases, technology layers, or server-side logic—microservice architecture utilizes cross-functional teams. The responsibilities of each team are to make specific products based on one or more individual services communicating via message bus. In microservices, a team owns the product for its lifetime.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">3- <strong>Simple Routing :</strong></span><br/><br/>\nMicroservices act in classicaly way : they receive requests, process them, and generate a response accordingly. This is opposite to how many other products such as ESBs (Enterprise Service Buses) work, where high-tech systems for message routing, choreography, and applying business rules are utilized.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">4- <strong>Decentralized :</strong></span><br/><br/>\nSince microservices involve a variety of technologies and platforms, old-school methods of centralized governance aren’t optimal. Decentralized governance is favored by the microservices community because its developers strive to produce useful tools that can then be used by others to solve the same problems. Just like decentralized governance, microservice architecture also favors decentralized data management. Monolithic systems use a single logical database across different applications. In a microservice application, each service usually manages its unique database.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">5- <strong>Failure Resistant :</strong></span><br/><br/>\nMicroservices architecture is well built to cope up with failures. There are different kinds of services are working together and communicating with each other and so chances are there that a service could fail. It can happen for a number of reasons. Here all the other services will be allowed to work while the non-functioning service is removed. Keeping an eye on microservices can help you prevent any service failure. This thing itself makes microservices complex compared to the normal monolithic architecture.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1><span style=\"color: SteelBlue;\">pros and cons of microservices</span></h1>\n<h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">1. <strong>Flexible tech stack</strong></span>: “We haven’t had to commit to a tech stack, we use the right tools for the problem e.g. if we have a machine learning problem we use Python as there is a wealth of open source libraries we can make use of. If we just want to do a restful API we use Node.js.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">2. <strong>Better fault isolation:</strong></span> if one microservice fails, the other will continue to work (although one problematic area of a monolith application can jeopardize the entire system).<br/><br/></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">3. <strong>Scaling:</strong></span> Easy to scale and integrate with third-party services.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">4. <strong>More manageable:</strong></span> “By taking a single complicated thing and breaking it into smaller things, they become easier to reason about.” This is the Unix design philosophy of building small things that work well (do one thing and do it well) and chaining them together through well-defined interfaces where appropriate.\n<br/><br/>\n<span style=\"color: #93003A;\">5. <strong>Independence:</strong></span> “Teams can have their own backlog of change and scale and release independently which allows the organisation as a whole to move faster.”<br/><br/></p>\n<h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>They add network and coordination overhead.</li>\n<li>Microservices can make testing more complex.</li>\n<li>Latency can be an issue, especially during heavy use.</li>\n<li>Being a distributed system, it can result in duplication of effort.</li>\n<li>When number of services increases, integration and managing whole products can become complicated.</li>\n<li>In addition to several complexities of monolithic architecture, the developers have to deal with the additional complexity of a distributed system.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h1><span style=\"color: SteelBlue;\">examples of microservice</span></h1>\n<p>Walmart successfully revitalized its failing architecture with microservices.\nThis is a good example of what should be done when aging architecture begins to negatively affect business. This is the multi-million dollar question which the IT Department of Walmart Canada had to address after they were failing on Black Fridays for two years in a row.</p>\n<p>The problem was that It couldn’t handle 6 million pageviews per minute and made it impossible to keep any kind of positive user experience anymore. Before embracing microservices, Walmart had an architecture for the internet of 2005, designed around desktops, laptops and monoliths.</p>\n<p>The company decided to replatform its old legacy system in 2012 since it was unable to scale for 6 million pageviews per minute and was down for most of the day during peak events. They wanted to prepare for the world by 2020, with 4 billion people connected, 25+ million apps available. So Walmart replatformed to a microservices architecture with the intention of achieving close to 100% availability with reasonable costs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\"><strong><em>Migrating to microservices actually brought notable results:</em></strong></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conversions were up by 20% literally overnight</li>\n<li>Mobile orders were up by 98% instantly</li>\n<li>No downtime on Black Friday or Boxing Day</li>\n<li>The operational savings were significant as well since the company moved off of its expensive hardware onto commodity hardware</li>\n<li>They saved 40% of the computing power and experienced 20-50% cost savings overall</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h1><span style=\"color: SteelBlue;\">how does microservice architecture work ?</span></h1>\n<p><br/><br/>\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/12f40/007-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.82421874999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"007-1\"\n        title=\"007-1\"\n        src=\"/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/6ff5e/007-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/135ae/007-1.png 300w,\n/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/34e8a/007-1.png 600w,\n/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/6ff5e/007-1.png 1200w,\n/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/79a4a/007-1.png 1800w,\n/static/5c3a63ef8e977005dd37a1f8c6625a10/12f40/007-1.png 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>A typical Microservice Architecture (MSA) should consist of the following components:<br/><br/></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">1. <strong>Clients :</strong></span> The architecture starts with different types of clients, from different devices trying to perform various management capabilities such as search, build, configure etc.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">2. <strong>Identity Providers:</strong></span> These requests from the clients are then passed on the identity providers who authenticate the requests of clients and communicate the requests to API Gateway.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">3. <strong>API Gateway:</strong></span> Since clients don’t call the services directly, API Gateway acts as an entry point for the clients to forward requests to appropriate microservices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#69B1D8;\"><strong><em>The advantages of using an API gateway include:</em></strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the services can be updated without the clients knowing.</li>\n<li>Services can also use messaging protocols that are not web friendly.</li>\n<li>The API Gateway can perform cross-cutting functions such as providing security, load balancing etc.</li>\n<li>After receiving the requests of clients, the internal architecture consists of microservices which communicate with each other through messages to handle client requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">4. <strong>Messaging Formats :</strong></span>\nThere are two types of messages through which they communicate:</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#69B1D8;\"><u><strong><em>Synchronous Messages:</em></strong></u></span> In the situation where clients wait for the responses from a service, Microservices usually tend to use REST (Representational State Transfer) as it relies on a stateless, client-server, and the HTTP protocol. This protocol is used as it is a distributed environment each and every functionality is represented with a resource to carry out operations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#69B1D8;\"><u><strong><em>Asynchronous Messages:</em></strong></u></span> In the situation where clients do not wait for the responses from a service, Microservices usually tend to use protocols such as AMQP, STOMP, MQTT. These protocols are used in this type of communication since the nature of messages is defined and these messages have to be interoperable between implementations.</p>\n<p>The next question that may come to your mind is how do the applications using Microservices handle their data?</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #93003A;\">5. <strong>Databases :</strong></span>\nWell, each Microservice owns a private database to capture their data and implement the respective business functionality.Also, the databases of Microservices are updated through their service API only.
